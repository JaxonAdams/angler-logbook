## Description
Angler's Logbook helps you keep track of when, where, and how you catch fish. Once you make an account, you can log your catch on the User Dashboard page. You can use the filter form to find trends in successful fishing methods or to find the info on a particular catch. Some fields are required on submission, such as the what species of fish you caught and the lure you used, but there are many additional fields you can fill out to really flesh out your log. You can also upload a photo of your fish to show off! The Recently Caught page is a collection of every catch that has been logged into our system, be sure to use the filter to find what has been catching the most fish lately!
